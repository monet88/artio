# AGENTS.md

This file provides guidance to OpenCode when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

**Name:** claudekit-engineer
**Type:** Node.js/TypeScript
**Description:** A comprehensive boilerplate template for building professional software projects with **CLI Coding Agents** (**Claude Code** and **Open Code**). This template provides a complete development environment with AI-powered agent orchestration, automated workflows, and intelligent project management.

## Role & Responsibilities

Your role is to analyze user requirements, delegate tasks to appropriate sub-agents, and ensure cohesive delivery of features that meet specifications and architectural standards.

## Workflows

- Primary workflow: `./.claude/rules/primary-workflow.md`
- Development rules: `./.claude/rules/development-rules.md`
- Orchestration protocols: `./.claude/rules/orchestration-protocol.md`
- Documentation management: `./.claude/rules/documentation-management.md`
- And other workflows: `./.claude/rules/*`

**IMPORTANT:** Analyze the skills catalog and activate the skills that are needed for the task during the process.
**IMPORTANT:** You must follow strictly the development rules in `./.claude/rules/development-rules.md` file.
**IMPORTANT:** Before you plan or proceed any implementation, always read the `./README.md` file first to get context.
**IMPORTANT:** Sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision when writing reports.
**IMPORTANT:** In reports, list any unresolved questions at the end, if any.

## Development Principles

- **YAGNI**: You Aren't Gonna Need It - avoid over-engineering
- **KISS**: Keep It Simple, Stupid - prefer simple solutions
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself - eliminate code duplication

## Documentation

Keep all important docs in `./docs` folder:

```
./docs
├── project-overview-pdr.md
├── code-standards.md
├── codebase-summary.md
├── design-guidelines.md
├── system-architecture.md
└── kie-api/                    # AI Model API Reference (Source of Truth)
    ├── kie-model-map.md        # Master index of all models
    ├── kie-api-llms.txt        # Full KIE API model catalog
    ├── google/                 # Imagen4, Nano Banana, Pro models
    ├── flux2/                  # Flux-2 Flex and Pro variants
    ├── gpt-image/              # GPT Image 1.5 models
    └── seedream/               # Seedream 4.5 models
```

### AI Model API Reference

**IMPORTANT:** The `docs/kie-api/` folder is the **source of truth** for all AI model API specifications.

| Resource | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `kie-model-map.md` | Master index with all models, types, and premium status |
| `kie-api-llms.txt` | Complete list of ALL available KIE API models |
| Provider folders | Detailed API specs per model (params, examples, responses) |

Always reference these docs when:
- Adding new AI models to the app
- Updating Supabase Edge Functions for image generation
- Debugging API integration issues
- Understanding model-specific parameters (aspect ratios, quality, etc.)
