# Agent Teams - CK-Native Orchestration Engine

Coordinate multiple independent Claude Code sessions. Each teammate has own context window, loads project context (CLAUDE.md, skills, agents), communicates via shared task list and messaging.

**Requires:** Agent Teams enabled. Set `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings.json env if using Claude Code < 2.1.33. May be GA in 2.1.33+.

## Usage

```
/team <template> <context> [flags]
```

**Templates:** `research`, `cook`, `review`, `debug`

**Flags:**
- `--devs N` | `--researchers N` | `--reviewers N` | `--debuggers N` — team size
- `--plan-approval` / `--no-plan-approval` — plan gate (default: on for cook)
- `--delegate` — lead only coordinates, never touches code

## Execution Protocol

**Pre-flight (MANDATORY — merged into step 2 of every template):**
1. Step 2 of every template calls `TeamCreate(team_name: "...", ...)`. Do NOT check whether the tool exists first — just call it.
2. If the call SUCCEEDS: continue with the template.
3. If the call returns an ERROR or is unrecognized: **STOP. Tell user:** "Agent Teams requires `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1` in settings.json. Team mode is not available."
4. Do NOT fall back to subagents. `/team` MUST use Agent Teams or abort.
5. All teammate spawns MUST include `team_name` parameter — never spawn Task without it.

When activated, IMMEDIATELY execute the matching template sequence below.
Do NOT ask for confirmation. Do NOT explain what you're about to do.
Execute the tool calls in order. Report progress after each major step.

## CK Context Block

Every teammate spawn prompt MUST include this context at the end:

```
CK Context:
- Work dir: {CK_PROJECT_ROOT or CWD}
- Reports: {CK_REPORTS_PATH or "plans/reports/"}
- Plans: {CK_PLANS_PATH or "plans/"}
- Branch: {CK_GIT_BRANCH or current branch}
- Naming: {CK_NAME_PATTERN or "YYMMDD-HHMM"}
- Active plan: {CK_ACTIVE_PLAN or "none"}
- Commits: conventional (feat:, fix:, docs:, refactor:, test:, chore:)
- Refer to teammates by NAME, not agent ID
```

## ON `/team research <topic>` [--researchers N]:

*Wraps /research skill — scope, gather, analyze, report.*

IMMEDIATELY execute in order:

1. **Derive N angles** from `<topic>` (default N=3):
   - Angle 1: Architecture, patterns, proven approaches
   - Angle 2: Alternatives, competing solutions, trade-offs
   - Angle 3: Risks, edge cases, failure modes, security
   - (If N>3, derive additional angles from topic context)

2. **CALL** `TeamCreate(team_name: "<topic-slug>")`

3. **CALL** `TaskCreate` x N — one per angle:
   - Subject: `Research: <angle-title>`
   - Description: `Investigate <angle> for topic: <topic>. Save report to: {CK_REPORTS_PATH}/researcher-{N}-{CK_NAME_PATTERN}-{topic-slug}.md. Format: Executive summary, key findings, evidence, recommendations. Mark task completed when done. Send findings summary to lead.`

4. **CALL** `Task` x N to spawn researcher teammates:
   - `subagent_type: "researcher"`, `team_name: "<topic-slug>"`, `model: "haiku"`
   - `name: "researcher-{N}"`
   - Prompt: task description + CK Context Block

5. **MONITOR** via TaskCompleted hook events + TaskList fallback:
   - TaskCompleted events auto-notify when researchers finish
   - Fallback: Check TaskList if no event received in 60s
   - If stuck >5 min, message teammate directly

6. **READ** all researcher reports from `{CK_REPORTS_PATH}/`

7. **SYNTHESIZE** into: `{CK_REPORTS_PATH}/research-summary-{CK_NAME_PATTERN}-{topic-slug}.md`
   Format: exec summary, key findings, comparative analysis, recommendations, unresolved questions.

8. **SHUTDOWN**: `SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request")` to each teammate

9. **CLEANUP**: `TeamDelete` (no parameters — just call it)

10. **REPORT**: Tell user `Research complete. Summary: {path}. N reports generated.`

---

## ON `/team cook <plan-path-or-description>` [--devs N]:

*Wraps /cook skill — plan, code, test, review, finalize.*

IMMEDIATELY execute in order:

1. **READ** plan (if path provided) OR create via planner teammate:
   - If description only: spawn `Task(subagent_type: "planner")` to create plan first
   - Parse plan into N independent task groups with file ownership boundaries

2. **CALL** `TeamCreate(team_name: "<feature-slug>")`

3. **CALL** `TaskCreate` x (N + 1) — N dev tasks + 1 tester task:
   - Dev tasks: include `File ownership: <glob patterns>` — NO overlap between devs
   - Tester task: `addBlockedBy` all dev task IDs
   - Each task description includes: implementation scope, file ownership, acceptance criteria

4. **CALL** `Task` x N to spawn developer teammates:
   - `subagent_type: "fullstack-developer"`, `mode: "plan"`
   - `model: "sonnet"`, `name: "dev-{N}"`
   - Prompt: task description + CK Context Block
   - REVIEW and APPROVE each developer's plan via `plan_approval_response`

5. **MONITOR** dev completion via TaskCompleted events:
   - TaskCompleted hook notifies when each dev task finishes
   - When all N dev tasks show completed, spawn tester immediately
   - TeammateIdle events confirm devs are available for shutdown
   - Fallback: Check TaskList if no events received in 60s
   - `Task(subagent_type: "tester", model: "haiku", name: "tester")`
   - Tester runs full test suite, reports pass/fail

6. **DOCS SYNC EVAL** (MANDATORY for cook — from /cook finalize):
   ```
   Docs impact: [none|minor|major]
   Action: [no update needed — <reason>] | [updated <page>] | [needs separate PR]
   ```

7. **SHUTDOWN** all teammates via `SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request")`
8. **CLEANUP**: `TeamDelete` (no parameters — just call it)

9. **REPORT**: Tell user what was cooked, test results, docs impact.

## ON `/team review <scope>` [--reviewers N]:

*Wraps /code-review skill — scout, review, synthesize with evidence gates.*

IMMEDIATELY execute in order:

1. **DERIVE** N review focuses from `<scope>` (default N=3):
   - Focus 1: Security — vulnerabilities, auth, input validation, OWASP
   - Focus 2: Performance — bottlenecks, memory, complexity, scaling
   - Focus 3: Test coverage — gaps, edge cases, error paths
   - (If N>3, derive from scope: architecture, DX, accessibility, etc.)

2. **CALL** `TeamCreate(team_name: "review-<scope-slug>")`

3. **CALL** `TaskCreate` x N — one per focus:
   - Subject: `Review: <focus-title>`
   - Description: `Review <scope> for <focus>. Output severity-rated findings only. Format: [CRITICAL|IMPORTANT|MODERATE] <finding> — <evidence> — <recommendation>. No "seems" or "probably" — concrete evidence only. Save to: {CK_REPORTS_PATH}/reviewer-{N}-{CK_NAME_PATTERN}-{scope-slug}.md. Mark task completed when done.`

4. **CALL** `Task` x N to spawn reviewers:
   - `subagent_type: "code-reviewer"`, `model: "haiku"`, `name: "reviewer-{N}"`
   - Prompt: task description + CK Context Block

5. **MONITOR** via TaskCompleted hook events + TaskList fallback:
   - TaskCompleted events auto-notify when reviewers finish
   - Fallback: Check TaskList if no event received in 60s

6. **SYNTHESIZE** into: `{CK_REPORTS_PATH}/review-{scope-slug}.md`
   - Deduplicate findings across reviewers
   - Prioritize by severity: CRITICAL > IMPORTANT > MODERATE
   - Create action items list with owners

7. **SHUTDOWN** all teammates via `SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request")`
8. **CLEANUP**: `TeamDelete` (no parameters — just call it)

9. **REPORT**: Tell user `Review complete. {X} findings ({Y} critical). Report: {path}.`

## ON `/team debug <issue>` [--debuggers N]:

*Wraps /fix skill — root-cause-first, adversarial hypotheses, disprove to converge.*

IMMEDIATELY execute in order:

1. **GENERATE** N competing hypotheses from `<issue>` (default N=3):
   - Each hypothesis must be independently testable
   - Each must predict different observable symptoms
   - Frame as: "If <cause>, then we should see <evidence>"

2. **CALL** `TeamCreate(team_name: "debug-<issue-slug>")`

3. **CALL** `TaskCreate` x N — one per hypothesis:
   - Subject: `Debug: Test hypothesis — <theory>`
   - Description: `Investigate hypothesis: <theory>. For issue: <issue>. ADVERSARIAL: actively try to disprove other theories. Message other debuggers to challenge findings. Report evidence FOR and AGAINST your theory. Save findings to: {CK_REPORTS_PATH}/debugger-{N}-{CK_NAME_PATTERN}-{issue-slug}.md. Mark task completed when done.`

4. **CALL** `Task` x N to spawn debugger teammates:
   - `subagent_type: "debugger"`, `model: "sonnet"`, `name: "debugger-{N}"`
   - Prompt: task description + CK Context Block

5. **MONITOR** via TaskCompleted events. Debuggers should message each other — let them converge.
   - TaskCompleted events notify as each hypothesis is tested
   - TeammateIdle events indicate debugger awaiting peer input
   - Fallback: Check TaskList if no events in 60s

6. **READ** all debugger reports. Identify surviving theory as root cause.

7. **WRITE** root cause report: `{CK_REPORTS_PATH}/debug-{issue-slug}.md`
   Format: Root cause, evidence chain, disproven hypotheses, recommended fix.

8. **SHUTDOWN** all teammates via `SendMessage(type: "shutdown_request")`
9. **CLEANUP**: `TeamDelete` (no parameters — just call it)

10. **REPORT**: Tell user `Debug complete. Root cause: <summary>. Report: {path}.`

## Agent Memory

Agents with `memory: project` retain learnings across team sessions. Memory persists in `.claude/agent-memory/<name>/` (gitignored). Useful for:
- Code reviewer remembering project conventions
- Debugger recalling past failure patterns
- Tester tracking flaky tests and coverage gaps

## When to Use Agent Teams vs Subagents

| Scenario | Subagents (Task tool) | Agent Teams |
|----------|----------------------|-------------|
| Focused task (test, lint, single review) | **Yes** | Overkill |
| Sequential chain (plan → code → test) | **Yes** | No |
| 3+ independent parallel workstreams | Maybe | **Yes** |
| Competing debug hypotheses | No | **Yes** |
| Cross-layer work (FE + BE + tests) | Maybe | **Yes** |
| Workers need to discuss/challenge findings | No | **Yes** |
| Token budget is tight | **Yes** | No (high cost) |

## Token Budget

| Template | Estimated Tokens | Model Strategy |
|----------|-----------------|----------------|
| Research (3) | ~150K-300K | haiku for all |
| Cook (4) | ~400K-800K | sonnet for devs, haiku for tester |
| Review (3) | ~100K-200K | haiku for all |
| Debug (3) | ~200K-400K | sonnet for all |

## Error Recovery

1. **Check status**: `Shift+Up/Down` (in-process) or click pane (split)
2. **Redirect**: Send direct message with corrective instructions
3. **Replace**: Shut down failed teammate, spawn replacement for same task
4. **Reassign**: `TaskUpdate` stuck task to unblock dependents

## Abort Team

```
Shut down all teammates. Then call TeamDelete (no parameters).
```

If unresponsive: close terminal or kill session. Clean orphaned configs at `~/.claude/teams/` manually.

## Display Modes

- **auto** (default): split panes if in tmux, otherwise in-process
- **in-process**: all in one terminal. `Shift+Up/Down` navigate. `Ctrl+T` task list.
- **tmux/split**: each teammate own pane. Requires tmux or iTerm2.
