## Security Restrictions

**Forbidden in frontmatter:**
- XML angle brackets (`< >`) — frontmatter appears in system prompt, could inject instructions
- Skills named with "claude" or "anthropic" prefix (reserved)

**Allowed:**
- Standard YAML types (strings, numbers, booleans, lists, objects)
- Custom metadata fields
- Long descriptions up to 1024 characters (project standard: 200)

## Description Examples

**Good — specific with triggers:**
```yaml
description: Analyzes Figma design files and generates developer handoff docs.
  Use when user uploads .fig files or asks for "design specs" or "design-to-code".
```

```yaml
description: Manages Linear project workflows including sprint planning and
  task creation. Use when user mentions "sprint", "Linear tasks", or "create tickets".
```

**Bad — vague or missing triggers:**
```yaml
description: Helps with projects.                              # Too vague
description: Creates sophisticated documentation systems.      # No triggers
description: Implements the Project entity model.              # Too technical
```
