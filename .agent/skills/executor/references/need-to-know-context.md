# Need-to-Know Context

Load ONLY what's necessary for current task:

**Always load:**
- The PLAN.md being executed
- .gsd/STATE.md for position context

**Load if referenced:**
- Files in `<context>` section
- Files in task `<files>`

**Never load automatically:**
- All previous SUMMARYs
- All phase plans
- Full architecture docs

**Principle:** Fresh context > accumulated context. Keep it minimal.
