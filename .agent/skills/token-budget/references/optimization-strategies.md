# Optimization Strategies

### 1. Progressive Loading

```
Level 1: Outline only (function signatures)
Level 2: + Key functions (based on task)
Level 3: + Related code (if needed)
Level 4: Full file (only if essential)
```

### 2. Just-In-Time Loading

- Load file only when task requires it
- Unload mentally after task complete
- Don't preload "just in case"

### 3. Search Before Load

Always use context-fetch skill first:
1. Search for relevant terms
2. Identify candidate files
3. Load only needed sections

### 4. Summarize & Compress

After understanding a file:
- Document key insights in STATE.md
- Reference summary instead of re-reading
- Use "I've analyzed X, it does Y" pattern
