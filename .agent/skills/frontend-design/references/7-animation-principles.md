# 7. Animation Principles

### Timing Concept

```
Duration based on:
├── Distance (further = longer)
├── Size (larger = slower)
├── Importance (critical = clear)
└── Context (urgent = fast, luxury = slow)
```

### Easing Selection

| Action | Easing | Why |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Entering | Ease-out | Decelerate, settle in |
| Leaving | Ease-in | Accelerate, exit |
| Emphasis | Ease-in-out | Smooth, deliberate |
| Playful | Bounce | Fun, energetic |

### Performance

- Animate only transform and opacity
- Respect reduced-motion preference
- Test on low-end devices
