# 1. Constraint Analysis (ALWAYS FIRST)

Before any design work, ANSWER THESE or ASK USER:

| Constraint | Question | Why It Matters |
|------------|----------|----------------|
| **Timeline** | How much time? | Determines complexity |
| **Content** | Ready or placeholder? | Affects layout flexibility |
| **Brand** | Existing guidelines? | May dictate colors/fonts |
| **Tech** | What stack? | Affects capabilities |
| **Audience** | Who exactly? | Drives all visual decisions |

### Audience → Design Approach

| Audience | Think About |
|----------|-------------|
| **Gen Z** | Bold, fast, mobile-first, authentic |
| **Millennials** | Clean, minimal, value-driven |
| **Gen X** | Familiar, trustworthy, clear |
| **Boomers** | Readable, high contrast, simple |
| **B2B** | Professional, data-focused, trust |
| **Luxury** | Restrained elegance, whitespace |
