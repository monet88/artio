# ⚠️ CRITICAL: ASK BEFORE ASSUMING (MANDATORY)

> **STOP! If the user's request is open-ended, DO NOT default to your favorites.**

### When User Prompt is Vague, ASK:

**Color not specified?** Ask:
> "What color palette do you prefer? (blue/green/orange/neutral/other?)"

**Style not specified?** Ask: 
> "What style are you going for? (minimal/bold/retro/futuristic/organic?)"

**Layout not specified?** Ask:
> "Do you have a layout preference? (single column/grid/asymmetric/full-width?)"

### ⛔ DEFAULT TENDENCIES TO AVOID (ANTI-SAFE HARBOR):

| AI Default Tendency | Why It's Bad | Think Instead |
|---------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Bento Grids (Modern Cliché)** | Used in every AI design | Why does this content NEED a grid? |
| **Hero Split (Left/Right)** | Predictable & Boring | How about Massive Typography or Vertical Narrative? |
| **Mesh/Aurora Gradients** | The "new" lazy background | What's a radical color pairing? |
| **Glassmorphism** | AI's idea of "premium" | How about solid, high-contrast flat? |
| **Deep Cyan / Fintech Blue** | Safe harbor from purple ban | Why not Red, Black, or Neon Green? |
| **"Orchestrate / Empower"** | AI-generated copywriting | How would a human say this? |
| Dark background + neon glow | Overused, "AI look" | What does the BRAND actually need? |
| **Rounded everything** | Generic/Safe | Where can I use sharp, brutalist edges? |

> 🔴 **"Every 'safe' structure you choose brings you one step closer to a generic template. TAKE RISKS."**
