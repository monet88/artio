# 2. UX Psychology Principles

### Core Laws (Internalize These)

| Law | Principle | Application |
|-----|-----------|-------------|
| **Hick's Law** | More choices = slower decisions | Limit options, use progressive disclosure |
| **Fitts' Law** | Bigger + closer = easier to click | Size CTAs appropriately |
| **Miller's Law** | ~7 items in working memory | Chunk content into groups |
| **Von Restorff** | Different = memorable | Make CTAs visually distinct |
| **Serial Position** | First/last remembered most | Key info at start/end |

### Emotional Design Levels

```
VISCERAL (instant)  → First impression: colors, imagery, overall feel
BEHAVIORAL (use)    → Using it: speed, feedback, efficiency
REFLECTIVE (memory) → After: "I like what this says about me"
```

### Trust Building

- Security indicators on sensitive actions
- Social proof where relevant
- Clear contact/support access
- Consistent, professional design
- Transparent policies
