# 10. Decision Process Summary

```
For EVERY design task:

1. CONSTRAINTS
   └── What's the timeline, brand, tech, audience?
   └── If unclear → ASK

2. CONTENT
   └── What content exists?
   └── What's the hierarchy?

3. STYLE DIRECTION
   └── What's appropriate for context?
   └── If unclear → ASK (don't default!)

4. EXECUTION
   └── Apply principles above
   └── Check against anti-patterns

5. REVIEW
   └── "Does this serve the user?"
   └── "Is this different from my defaults?"
   └── "Would I be proud of this?"
```
