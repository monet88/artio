# 4. Color Principles

### 60-30-10 Rule

```
60% → Primary/Background (calm, neutral base)
30% → Secondary (supporting areas)
10% → Accent (CTAs, highlights, attention)
```

### Color Psychology (For Decision Making)

| If You Need... | Consider Hues | Avoid |
|----------------|---------------|-------|
| Trust, calm | Blue family | Aggressive reds |
| Growth, nature | Green family | Industrial grays |
| Energy, urgency | Orange, red | Passive blues |
| Luxury, creativity | Deep Teal, Gold, Emerald | Cheap-feeling brights |
| Clean, minimal | Neutrals | Overwhelming color |

### Selection Process

1. **What's the industry?** (narrows options)
2. **What's the emotion?** (picks primary)
3. **Light or dark mode?** (sets foundation)
4. **ASK USER** if not specified
