# Retrieval and Networking

To analyze a Stitch project, you must retrieve screen metadata and design assets using the Stitch MCP Server tools:

1. **Namespace discovery**: Run `list_tools` to find the Stitch MCP prefix. Use this prefix (e.g., `mcp_stitch:`) for all subsequent calls.

2. **Project lookup** (if Project ID is not provided):
   - Call `[prefix]:list_projects` with `filter: "view=owned"` to retrieve all user projects
   - Identify the target project by title or URL pattern
   - Extract the Project ID from the `name` field (e.g., `projects/13534454087919359824`)

3. **Screen lookup** (if Screen ID is not provided):
   - Call `[prefix]:list_screens` with the `projectId` (just the numeric ID, not the full path)
   - Review screen titles to identify the target screen (e.g., "Home", "Landing Page")
   - Extract the Screen ID from the screen's `name` field

4. **Metadata fetch**: 
   - Call `[prefix]:get_screen` with both `projectId` and `screenId` (both as numeric IDs only)
   - This returns the complete screen object including:
     - `screenshot.downloadUrl` - Visual reference of the design
     - `htmlCode.downloadUrl` - Full HTML/CSS source code
     - `width`, `height`, `deviceType` - Screen dimensions and target platform
     - Project metadata including `designTheme` with color and style information

5. **Asset download**:
   - Use `web_fetch` or `read_url_content` to download the HTML code from `htmlCode.downloadUrl`
   - Optionally download the screenshot from `screenshot.downloadUrl` for visual reference
   - Parse the HTML to extract Tailwind classes, custom CSS, and component patterns

6. **Project metadata extraction**:
   - Call `[prefix]:get_project` with the project `name` (full path: `projects/{id}`) to get:
     - `designTheme` object with color mode, fonts, roundness, custom colors
     - Project-level design guidelines and descriptions
     - Device type preferences and layout principles
