# Analysis & Synthesis Instructions

### 1. Extract Project Identity (JSON)
- Locate the Project Title
- Locate the specific Project ID (e.g., from the `name` field in the JSON)

### 2. Define the Atmosphere (Image/HTML)
Evaluate the screenshot and HTML structure to capture the overall "vibe." Use evocative adjectives to describe the mood (e.g., "Airy," "Dense," "Minimalist," "Utilitarian").

### 3. Map the Color Palette (Tailwind Config/JSON)
Identify the key colors in the system. For each color, provide:
- A descriptive, natural language name that conveys its character (e.g., "Deep Muted Teal-Navy")
- The specific hex code in parentheses for precision (e.g., "#294056")
- Its specific functional role (e.g., "Used for primary actions")

### 4. Translate Geometry & Shape (CSS/Tailwind)
Convert technical `border-radius` and layout values into physical descriptions:
- Describe `rounded-full` as "Pill-shaped"
- Describe `rounded-lg` as "Subtly rounded corners"
- Describe `rounded-none` as "Sharp, squared-off edges"

### 5. Describe Depth & Elevation
Explain how the UI handles layers. Describe the presence and quality of shadows (e.g., "Flat," "Whisper-soft diffused shadows," or "Heavy, high-contrast drop shadows").
