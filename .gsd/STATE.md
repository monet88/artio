## Current Position
- **Milestone**: UI & Concurrency Polish
- **Phase**: 3 (completed)
- **Task**: All tasks complete
- **Status**: Verified

## Last Session Summary
Phase 3 executed successfully. Validated >10MB constraints for image picking, wrapped gallery grid with `RefreshIndicator` for forced user cache updates, and swapped the optimistic deletion UX for an explicit Dialog-based gate so users don't mistakenly delete items irreversibly. Milestone is now complete.

## Next Steps
1. Project milestones fully addressed. Create a new milestone with `/new-milestone`.
